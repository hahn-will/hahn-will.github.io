        Hi,
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm Will
        <br />
        I'm a Computer Science Major at Purdue University. I'm interested in
        almost anything involving computers or music. Throughout high school I
        participated in band and thats where I've developed my passion for
        music. In college I've pursued other activities and I'm still finding
        my place. I'm still finding my passion within the many areas of computer
        science. Whether it's machine learning, software development, or
        something I haven't thought of yet, I'm excited by the opportunities in
        front of me.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the recent years, I began programming more everyday. I began with
        simple programs that I used to help me understand what programming
        truly was. The further I've gone in my journey as a programmer, I've
        begun creating more complex programs that help me accomplish various
        tasks. Prior to college, these were tasks like modifying a large number
        of images to increase the ease of use for class project. By the end of
        high school, I began expanding programming projects to other classes.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of high school, I created a neural network for my english
        class. I decided to research how efficiently I could train the neural
        network. This was a great experience, and I learned through this project
        that my passion truly is computer science. In math class that same year,
        I did fourier transformations for my final project. Through this project
        I learned how enjoyable it was to apply mathematical concepts in
        programming. These two projects helped solidify my passion in computer
        science.
        <br />
        <br />
        I participated in band for several years in high school. It was a great
        experience and we succeeded at a high level. Band was the organization
        that helped me develop my passion for music. I'm interested to find out
        where these passions may take me.
