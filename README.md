This is the repository for my website www.williamhahn.com. Feel free to explore the code and look at what I've used.
## APIs
Uses Bootstrap 4 with all the expected dependencies you would have with bootstrap www.getbootstrap.com
## Images
Most images are rendered, generated, or taken myself. Any images not under that category (including those in renders) are open source or under a license allowing virtually unlimited use including commercial use.
## Font
The font for the "Contact Me" buttons is Font Awesome so I can get the logos of the social media logos. The font for the website is Playfair Display.
