# hahn-will.github.io
This is the repository for my website www.williamhahn.com. Feel free to explore the code and look at what I've used.
## Bootstrap
My website uses bootstrap to implement the mobile friendly functionality. I used a web app that can be found at https://bootstrap.build/app to help me figure out using the bootstrap API and to help me create a simple design for the website.
## Images
All the images are either open source or they are images I've generated or taken myself. If you would like more information on this feel free to contact me by going to my website.
## awesomefonts
I implemented the social media icons at the bottom of the page using awesomefonts to get the icons I needed for those Social media platforms.
## Questions?
